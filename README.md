hello codebots and inspirational creatures of the universe

V here. I'm learning how to code, design, and program networks. Most recently I am learning how to play several instruments, which my favorite ones are the drums (African, rock, and jazz), bass, and ukelele. If you find me eating something in my spare time you may catch me  with some cheese, seaweed, kale, or dark chocolate. Catch me drinking wheat beers, ciders, and red blends to even it all out.
